# Re-building planets-site

Some years back I made planets-site here, https://github.com/HawiCaesar/planets-site. (I didnt finish apparently life ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚)

Now this repo is a replica but built using claude-4-sonnet, agent mode on cursor.

Still a work in progress
- Mobile responsiveness on small screens like ipad have some issues
- planet images are squeezed on some smaller screens
- clean up of unnecessary file
